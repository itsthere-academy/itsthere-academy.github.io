By this time I may have lost you. There's cloud computing, learning the sky and toolkit for space exploration. Almost like going three different directions.

Bear with me. There is a plan.

I still want to lear how the sky "works" and how to spot the most common objects. It happens that I'm a programmer and I learn this kind of things by visualizing it with my computer. Just need to crunch the data myself. I will be making fundamental mistakes, but there is a flawless way to verify my understanding. Go check the sky - if something's not there I think it should, I'm wrong.

I need to come up with the way to visualize things for myself. I'm considering 3rd person perspective - looking at Solar System from far away, to see it's neighborhood. I don't want to keep it to myself - I want to make it an app, host it somewhere.

This takes us to cloud computing. If you can read this, I already figured out how to book a domain and host this blog. And I found a way to make it really inexpensive :) Over time, I will need some compute power to host the application. This is where cloud computing comes into play - how much does it really cost for a hobbyist? Should you kick off your Patronite campaign?

Then my writing skills. As you may have noticed, English is not my first language. You would be so surprised not different Polish and English can be!

Last but not least - writing things down help me understand. Can I explain clearly, or is this cloudy in my head? Something like [rubber duck method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).

I suspect the IT aspects would be easier for me. Or maybe I'm wrong? Maybe I'm underestimating because I got spoiled by Enterprise IT where the challenges are different?

I need to warn you I will sidetrack A LOT. I already can't stop thinking of simulating the Solar System with Newton's laws + SPICE data. And why do I want to vectorize it into [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)?

The next posts will discuss using SPICE and how do I even host this blog. The second one sounds dull, but there are gotchas... oh, there are...

Let's go!
