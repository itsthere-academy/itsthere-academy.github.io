My name is Piotr Szukalski. I live in the suburbs of Warsaw, Poland. A family guy in the first place. Then seasoned computer programmer and architect. Trained in electronics, but also maths and (astro)physics hobbyist.

My journey into computers and programming started in my early teens. Anyone else taking first steps with [Amiga 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_500) and [Amos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOS_%28programming_language%29)? Darn me, I owe my school nickname to this machine! 

There was no return for me - I soon learned C (from the sacred [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language)) then [Motorola 68k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series) assembler. I graduated from secondary school of electronics, then got masters in computer science. Now I knew both - how computers work and how to make them do what I want. 

Well, at least how to try persuading them.

For many years I've been into enterprise IT and always dreamed of having toys like this at home. In many ways cloud computing gives me just that. If IT was not demanding enough, I also dived into astrophysics and numerical methods/machine learning.

I started wondering if what I've learnt so far can be of any use for the community? Can I blend it into one, bigger hobby? Are there others sharing the passion and can we learn together?

My university professor shared a tip with us the other day - so much is getting published these days, the only way to keep up is publishing even faster. This is a good reason too.

Here I come!
